# Gesture-Control
The Gesture Control Car is an IoT-based project that enables users to control a vehicle’s movement through simple hand gestures. Using sensors and microcontrollers, it detects directional gestures to move forward, backward, left, or right. This project highlights real-time human–machine interaction, robotics, and automation.
